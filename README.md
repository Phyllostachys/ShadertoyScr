## Examples
Run some of the shaders that come with this like this:
```
ShadertoyScr shaders/hexes.frag
```
If you run ShadertoyScr without any arguments then it'll run hexes.frag.

Hexes was inspired by this [shader from Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Xd2GR3) (I think).
Sun is from [here](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4lfSzS).
